## 🛠️ Development & Deployment Workflow

### Development

1. Make your changes to the source files
2. Test locally with `npm run dev`
3. Commit your changes to the main branch

### Deployment

We use a Phaser-themed deployment script that makes deployment fun and easy!

```bash
# Run the deployment script
./deploy.sh
```

The script will:
1. Generate a fun Phaser-themed commit message with date and time
2. Commit and push your changes to the main branch
3. Build the project for production
4. Create/update the deploy branch with the built files
5. Push the deploy branch to GitHub

Your site will be live at: https://hubofwyn.github.io/myfort/
